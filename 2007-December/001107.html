<PRE>Hello. I have a question concerning proper sip message exchange between
OpenIMS and an Application Server. I am new to this subject, so my question
might not make a lot of sense. Reading through the RFC 3261 and
documentation on IMS- AS sample flows, i am still a bit confused about how
the proper routing can be made in a simple ue1-OpenIMS(-AS)-ue2 call flow.

In particular, If I have got this right, the record-route header must be
updated by adding the AS's uri only in case we want AS to act as a proxy
server (correct me if this is wrong).

What if the AS doesn't work as a proxy at all, and for some reason decides
to reject the call from being processed from it? Thus, detaching itself from
the original request' s path, letting IMS send it to its original
destination, as if no AS exists for the rest of the flow.

I.e., in a simple bob-call-alice call case, although the criteria have been
met, and the event is forwarded to the AS, the AS decides that eventually
the user must not receive the service it provides (i.e. a call block), but
continue its route towards its original destination. (the condition on which
the service must not be delivered is beyond IMS filter criteria, i.e. in AS
logic).  In this case, how can the AS inform IMS for this? Is this possible,
or once the trigger happens the AS will remain in the signaling path in any
case?


I really appreciate your help beforehand, and apologize for length.
