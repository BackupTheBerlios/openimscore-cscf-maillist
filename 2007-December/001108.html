<PRE>Hi Gary,

&gt;<i> In particular, If I have got this right, the record-route header must be
</I>&gt;<i> updated by adding the AS's uri only in case we want AS to act as a proxy
</I>&gt;<i> server (correct me if this is wrong).
</I>
No, the S-CSCF includes two additional Route-header fields (not
Record-Route!) in any case if an iFC matches. The first point to the AS and
the second points back to the S-CSCF.
 
&gt;<i> What if the AS doesn't work as a proxy at all, and for some reason decides
</I>&gt;<i> to reject the call from being processed from it? Thus, detaching itself
</I>&gt;<i> from the original request' s path, letting IMS send it to its original
</I>&gt;<i> destination, as if no AS exists for the rest of the flow.
</I>
If the AS decides to do nothing with the session it has only to follow
correct SIP routing rules and use the next Route header to forward the
request.

&gt;<i> I.e., in a simple bob-call-alice call case, although the criteria have
</I>&gt;<i> been met, and the event is forwarded to the AS, the AS decides that
</I>&gt;<i> eventually the user must not receive the service it provides (i.e. a call
</I>&gt;<i> block), but continue its route towards its original destination. (the
</I>&gt;<i> condition on which the service must not be delivered is beyond IMS filter
</I>&gt;<i> criteria, i.e. in AS logic).  In this case, how can the AS inform IMS for
</I>&gt;<i> this? Is this possible, or once the trigger happens the AS will remain in
</I>&gt;<i> the signaling path in any case?
</I>
As mentioned above only simple SIP route does it. If the AS does not
&quot;record-route&quot; - as I can assume in that case - it will not be touched by
subsequent requests anymore.

Regards
Franz
