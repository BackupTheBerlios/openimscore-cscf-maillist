New Revision: 702 <A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/openimscore?view=rev&amp;rev=702">http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/openimscore?view=rev&amp;rev=702</A> 

Log:
Rewrote the receiver.c for sip-router adaptation reasons. Also it seems that the old implementation might have been in conflict with assumptions on the static nature of the process table in ser.
The receiver processes are no longer dynamic, but static. There is one receiver process for each initially configured peer and one for all the other unknown peers. Potentially all receivers could handle multiple peers, in case some more advanced load balancing would be required.
The file descriptors of the TCP sockets are passed between processes to achieve this effect:
- from acceptor to respective receiver
- from receiver for unknown peers to dedicated receiver after capabilities exchange and identification of a pre-configure peer
- from timer process to receiver on locally initiated connection.
