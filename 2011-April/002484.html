<PRE>Hi Carsten,

this is of course great news! If you would also find time to write or at
least link from our SVN and openimscore.org website to your work, I
think everyone here will appreciate it greatly. For example a simple
how-to like our Installation Guide would be very good. Also maybe you
could update the Download pages to additionally point to your branch there?

An OpenIMSCore revamp is long overdue as we are still kind of stuck on a
very old version of SIP Express Router. I am sure that this will bring a
lot of more power to the CSCFs and also flexibility.

For any rights, we would like to implement a WiKi-like style of version
control, so you and anyone that would like to make changes in the
repository and/or website, just let me know your account name on BerliOs
(respectively www.openimscore.org) and I will put you in the required ACLs.

You have quite a big plan, so probably the functionality will be
available in parallel from 2 options - the old modules and the new ones,
with the old ones gradually phased out.

What would be great is to keep the common modules in a single place. For
example the cdp module for Diameter will probably stay mostly the same,
so I don't know, but maybe you could just use it as svn:external? I am
doing this for all FOKUS projects for the following modules: cdp,
cdp_avp, Client_Rf. This means that there were many bug-fixes and
improvements there, even though these did not come from the OpenIMSCore
project.

P.S. I unfortunately was quite inactive in the past years, as I am
putting all my energy in a new project. I can only maintain now the
Diameter module. Otherwise from FOKUS Ancuta Onofrei/Corici is still a
bit active in the Emergency related topics and a bit more in the Rx and
Rf implementations for Policy and Charging Control. But in any case,
don't worry on changing things ;-).


Cheers,
-Dragos

</I>&gt;<i> i just wanted to notice, that i am actually working on re-integrating
</I>&gt;<i> the OpenIMS-core into the sip-router.org/Kamailio project.
</I>&gt;<i> It is not a fork of the official OpenIMSCore project, but more a merge
</I>&gt;<i> of the OpenIMScore Project into the Kamailio/sip-router.org project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a first step, i've made all the CSCF modules compile and work with

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a second step, i am working on a better integration into the
</I>&gt;<i> existing structures of the Kamailio project; i want to achieve the
</I>&gt;<i> following things:
</I>&gt;<i> - replace integrated dialog awareness of the CSCF modules with
</I>&gt;<i> Kamailio's dialog module
</I>&gt;<i> - replcae integrated registrar of the CSCF modules with Kamailio's
</I>&gt;<i> registrar module
</I>&gt;<i> - replace integrated nathelper support with the sip-router.org
</I>&gt;<i> nathelper/rtpproxy moduels
</I>&gt;<i> - replcae integrated RFC 3680 support with Kamailio's
</I>&gt;<i> Presence/Presence-User-Agent modules
</I>&gt;<i> - add documentation in accordance with the other sip-router.org modules
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've already changed quite a few things in the Kamailio core, in order
</I>&gt;<i> to achieve this: K's dialog module is now able to store additional
</I>&gt;<i> data to a dialog (works great), K's usrloc/registrar module is able to
</I>&gt;<i> store additional information to an contact (still buggy) and i have
</I>&gt;<i> already added support for RFC 3680 to Kamailio's presence/pua
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure (when you register, the system will &quot;PUBLISH&quot; the
</I>&gt;<i> registration state; another system may already &quot;SUBSCRIBE&quot; to the
</I>&gt;<i> status and &quot;NOTIFY&quot; requests are already parsed (but not stored yet)).
</I>&gt;<i> So it is going on. I have also already modified some of the config to
</I>&gt;<i> use generic append_hf() and remove_hf() functions instead of custom
</I>&gt;<i> implemented functions...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The progress is slow but steady since i work on it apart from my
</I>&gt;<i> regular work. I try to publish any new developments on this on my
</I>&gt;<i> blog/homepage (www.ng-voice.com), where you may also find some more
</I>&gt;<i> information about the installation and the components of the project
</I>&gt;<i> (i provide a repository of the last step for easy installation).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I started implementing an own HSS some time ago (openhss.org), but the
</I>&gt;<i> development on this currently stopped. First, i do not have enough
</I>&gt;<i> time to work on both the Kamailio integration, regular work and the
</I>&gt;<i> HSS; second the main developer on the HSS (Brian) just resigned due to
</I>&gt;<i> health reasons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of you may have noticed, that i am working for Telefonica in
</I>&gt;<i> Germany as a regular work. I am working on the Class 4/5
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure at Telefonica and we have already implemented an
</I>&gt;<i> Ericsson IMS core. However, i wanted to mention, that neither
</I>&gt;<i> Telefonica nor O2 is behind this project. The only support i get from
</I>&gt;<i> Telefonica is, that i get a monthly salary and that i may use some
</I>&gt;<i> time to work on the OpenIMS-project during normal office-hours (as
</I>&gt;<i> time allows).
</I>&gt;<i> If i do things, i do it by heart and not half-hearted... that probably
</I>&gt;<i> explains a lot of the effort spent on the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Carsten
</I>&gt;<i>
