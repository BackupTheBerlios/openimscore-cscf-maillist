<PRE>Hi everyone,

i just wanted to notice, that i am actually working on re-integrating
the OpenIMS-core into the sip-router.org/Kamailio project.
It is not a fork of the official OpenIMSCore project, but more a merge
of the OpenIMScore Project into the Kamailio/sip-router.org project.

As a first step, i've made all the CSCF modules compile and work with
a current Kamailio source. In order to do this, only minor adaptions
were required.

As a second step, i am working on a better integration into the
existing structures of the Kamailio project; i want to achieve the
following things:
- replace integrated dialog awareness of the CSCF modules with
Kamailio's dialog module
- replcae integrated registrar of the CSCF modules with Kamailio's
registrar module
- replace integrated nathelper support with the sip-router.org
nathelper/rtpproxy moduels
- replcae integrated RFC 3680 support with Kamailio's
Presence/Presence-User-Agent modules
- add documentation in accordance with the other sip-router.org modules

I've already changed quite a few things in the Kamailio core, in order
to achieve this: K's dialog module is now able to store additional
data to a dialog (works great), K's usrloc/registrar module is able to
store additional information to an contact (still buggy) and i have
already added support for RFC 3680 to Kamailio's presence/pua
infrastructure (when you register, the system will &quot;PUBLISH&quot; the
registration state; another system may already &quot;SUBSCRIBE&quot; to the
status and &quot;NOTIFY&quot; requests are already parsed (but not stored yet)).
So it is going on. I have also already modified some of the config to
use generic append_hf() and remove_hf() functions instead of custom
implemented functions...

The progress is slow but steady since i work on it apart from my
regular work. I try to publish any new developments on this on my
blog/homepage (www.ng-voice.com), where you may also find some more
information about the installation and the components of the project
(i provide a repository of the last step for easy installation).

I started implementing an own HSS some time ago (openhss.org), but the
development on this currently stopped. First, i do not have enough
time to work on both the Kamailio integration, regular work and the
HSS; second the main developer on the HSS (Brian) just resigned due to
health reasons.

Some of you may have noticed, that i am working for Telefonica in
Germany as a regular work. I am working on the Class 4/5
infrastructure at Telefonica and we have already implemented an
Ericsson IMS core. However, i wanted to mention, that neither
Telefonica nor O2 is behind this project. The only support i get from
Telefonica is, that i get a monthly salary and that i may use some
time to work on the OpenIMS-project during normal office-hours (as
time allows).
If i do things, i do it by heart and not half-hearted... that probably
explains a lot of the effort spent on the project.

Kind regards,
Carsten
