<PRE>But on top of that you have e.g. section 5.4.5 of 3GPP TS 24.229-730
for the S-CSCF.
The question is: does session expiration constitute &quot;an network
internal indication to release a session&quot;? Section 5.4.5.3 seems to
imply that it should only delete the dialog state, not terminate it...
What do you think?

JF

5.4.5	Call release
5.4.5.1	S-CSCF-initiated session release
5.4.5.1.1	Cancellation of a session currently being established
Upon receipt of an network internal indication to release a session
which is currently being established, the S-CSCF shall cancel the
related dialogs by sending the CANCEL request according to the
procedures described in RFC 3261 [26].
5.4.5.1.2	Release of an existing session
Upon receipt of a network internal indication to release an existing
multimedia session, the S-CSCF shall:
1)	generate the first BYE request for the called user based on the
information saved for the related dialog, including:
-	a Request-URI, set to the stored Contact header provided by the called user;
-	a To header, set to the To header value as received in the 200 OK
response for the initial INVITE request;
-	a From header, set to the From header value as received in the
initial INVITE request;
-	a Call-ID header, set to the Call-Id header value as received in the
initial INVITE request;
-	a CSeq header, set to the CSeq value that was stored for the
direction from the calling to the called user, incremented by one;
-	a Route header, set to the routeing information towards the called
user as stored for the dialog;
-	a Reason header that contains proper SIP response code;
-	further headers, based on local policy.
2)	generate the second BYE request for the calling user based on the
information saved for the related dialog, including:
-	a Request-URI, set to the stored Contact header provided by the calling user;
-	a To header, set to the From header value as received in the initial
INVITE request;
-	a From header, set to the To header value as received in the 200 OK
response for the initial INVITE request;
-	a Call-ID header, set to the Call-Id header value as received in the
initial INVITE request;
-	a CSeq header, set to the CSeq value that was stored for the
direction from the called to the calling user, incremented by one &#168;C if
no CSeq value was stored for that session it shall generate and apply
a random number within the valid range for CSeqs;
-	a Route header, set to the routeing information towards the calling
user as stored for the dialog;
-	a Reason header that contains proper SIP response code;
-	further headers, based on local policy.
3)	if the S-CSCF serves the calling user, treat the first BYE request
as if received directly from the calling user, i.e. send it to
internal service control and based on the outcome further on towards
the called user;
4)	if the S-CSCF serves the calling user, send the second BYE request
directly to the calling user.
5)	if the S-CSCF serves the called user, send the first BYE request
directly to the called user;
6)	if the S-CSCF serves the called user, treat the second BYE request
as if received directly from the called user, i.e. shall send it to
internal service control and based on the outcome further on towards
to the calling user.
Upon receipt of the 2xx responses for both BYE requests, the S-CSCF
shall release all information related to the dialog and the related
multimedia session.
5.4.5.1.2A	Release of the existing dialogs due to registration expiration
When the registration lifetime of the only public user identity
currently registered with its associated set of implicitly registered
public user identities (i.e. no other is registered) expires while
there are still active multimedia sessions that includes this user,
where the session was initiated with the public user identity
currently registered or with one of the implicitly registered public
used identities, the S-CSCF shall release each of these multimedia
sessions by applying the steps listed in the subclause 5.4.5.1.2.
5.4.5.1.3	Abnormal cases
Upon receipt of a request on a dialog for which the S-CSCF initiated
session release, the S-CSCF shall terminate the received request and
answer it with a 481 (Call/Transaction Does Not Exist) response.
5.4.5.2	Session release initiated by any other entity
Upon receipt of a 2xx response for a BYE request matching an existing
dialog, the S-CSCF shall delete all the stored information related to
the dialog.
5.4.5.3	Session expiration
If the S-CSCF requested the session to be refreshed periodically, and
the S-CSCF got the indication that the session will be refreshed, when
the session timer expires, the S-CSCF shall delete all the stored
information related to the dialog.
