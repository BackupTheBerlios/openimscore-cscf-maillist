<PRE>Hi,
 
I think it would be helpful for you to also check out 3GPP TS 23.218,
especially chapter 9, as it specifies the call model used in IMS.
 
Chapter 9 considers Application Servers in particular, and specifies 5
&quot;modes of operation&quot; for AS: terminating UA, originating UA, proxy,
3PCC/B2BUA, and &quot;no involvement&quot;. The last one applies to both sessions
where the AS never was involved in, and for sessions where it was part in
for example during establishing the session but not mid-session. An example
of the latter is a redirect server.
 
Then, refer to RFC3261 &amp; friends
(<A HREF="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sip-hitchhikers-guide">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sip-hitchhikers-guide</A> is a good place
to find out who the &quot;friends&quot; are) for the details.
 
Best regards,
Andreas

Hello again,

thank you very much for these explanations! I think I was confused because I
thought 
that if AS works as a proxy, than all responses following a request that
reaches AS 
must pass through the same path backwards, no matter what the Route or
Record-Route 
Header contains. I will study again on 3261 taking your helpful notes into
account, and 
provide you with feedback, i hope a successful one next time!

Thank you, 

Gary

Yes. This also results from basic SIP routing behaviour. If a server
receives a request it has to look into the Route header and according to RFC
3261 &#167;16.4: ... If the first value in the Route header field indicates this 
proxy, the proxy MUST remove that value from the request.


&gt;<i> In this case, the request will travel

</I>&gt;<i> this request? I assume no other header
</I>&gt;<i> should be touched for this task?
</I>

This depends on the behaviour of the AS. It might act as a proxy or as a
B2BUA or as an originating UA. This requires to act on various headers 
accordingly.


&gt;<i> Is this the way that all the next requests/responses for this call will
</I>&gt;<i> not be forwarded to AS (and leave
</I>&gt;<i> all routing from this point on to OpenIMS) ?
</I>

If the AS acts as a proxy and it does not set Record-Route it will not see
any further request/response of the dialog. If the AS acts as a B2BUA it
will.

Regards
Franz



Hi Gary,

well, the AS can in any case modify the request if it wants to. Some 
things should remain the same, like the Call-ID, or else this will be
consider another dialog (which is not that bad if the first one is also
handled - the B2BUA AS case);. In any case, for the ISC to work the AS 
should just behave according to RFC 3261 and do the loose-routing on the
Route headers. The first one is itself and as such would be removed and
the 2nd is the S-CSCF which will allow the message to return the the 
proper S-CSCF. Nothing but proper SIP routing.

Then if it wants to see the rest of the dialog, it should add a
Record-Route to itself, just as any other SIP proxy would. If not, it
shouldn't. Then all in-dialog routing would happen as standard SIP RFC 
mentions.

Simple SIP routing, nothing fancy ;-)

Cheers,
-Dragos
