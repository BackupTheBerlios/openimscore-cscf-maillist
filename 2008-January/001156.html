<PRE>Dear all,
I'm Andrea, a Phd student.

I'm developing a IMS client (starting from the IMS communicator) that 
manage more of one IP address simultaneously.
For change my address when I'm on-call I'm using the reinvite method.
That means:
1) I register my contact. In the 200 OK, there is the service route header.
 I have to use it as route header to each new dialog that I wold like 
establish.(we can call this service route)
2) I establish a call sending an INVITE that contains this route header. 
I receive a 200 OK that contains a Record Route Header. I have to use 
reversed as route header for each new request inside the dialog, for 
ACK, BYE etc. (we call this session route).
Now, if I want to change my ip address (but not my PCSCF) without lose 
the call:
1) I must send a new register with a different contact.
2) I must send a RE-INVITE.
The question is:
which should be the Route Header in the re-Invite???

For me, because the re invite is in the same dialog (same call-Id and 
same tags), I have to use the session route (reversed to the record 
route in the 200 ok for the invite).
But if I use it, the P-CSCF send me a &quot;400 Bad Request - Not following 
indicated Service-Routes&quot;. So I'm using the service-route and everything 
it is ok.

But if I want change again my address, to go back to my first interface, 
and I send again a reInvite I receive:

a &quot;400 - Bad Request - Not following indicated dialog routes&quot;
if I use the service route and
a  &quot;403 - Forbidden - Not Registered! You must register first with a S-CSCF&quot;
 if I use the session Route header.

Obviously each time I change interface, I send a REGISTER and I wait its 
200 Ok before to send the Re-Invite (so I'm sure about my client is 
registered).

So please, can we help me to understand which should be the correct 
route header that I have to use in a re-INVITE request?

Thank you in advance

Andrea
