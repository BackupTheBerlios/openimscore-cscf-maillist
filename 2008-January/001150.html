<PRE>Hi Nick,

My responses inlined below...

&gt;<i> I think we &quot;talk&quot; at cross :-),  in the most facts you write before i fully

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>it's email and this is the only way it works ;-).
&gt;<i> So the client will send a Register to our P-CSCF and our P-CSCF should send this
</I>&gt;<i> register to our I-CSCF but now there should be the change.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Here I don't see what the purpose of your first I-CSCF is. According to
the IMS standards, the I-CSCF does not do this kind of work. If you just
want to route all your messages from the P-CSCF through and IBCF, then
why don't you just add a Route header to the message in the P-CSCF???
and send the message there by normal SIP routing procedures? Check the
Service-Route and Path RFCs and see that there can be multiple values in
these headers, including such an IBCF. The IBCF is actually included I
think since 3GPP Rel7 (you might reinvent the wheel there, but I don't
know for sure). I fail to see why you still need that I-CSCF and you
also need to hijack DNS, to a broadcast and things like that.
&gt;<i> The I-CSCF notice that this Register can not processed by our S-CSCF because we
</I>&gt;<i> dont know the network and so our S-CSCF don't has the User-Profile.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Is this done through UAR and actually the HSS &quot;notices&quot; it? If yes, I
think it's just wasted resources on one extra signaling. Normally, the
standards are thought to use DNS to redirect all the domain queries like
the one for the REGISTER's Request-URI towards I-CSCFs that are
responsible for those domains. This information is stored in DNS, so
it's accessible also by the P-CSCF or the IBCF, which can directly make
a decision, without a pseudo-I-CSCF in the middle.
&gt;<i> So the the I-CSCF should look in a database if there is an entry for the network
</I>&gt;<i>  [open-ims.sk] and a IBCF.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>The IBCF can do this without your pseudo-I-CSCF I think...
&gt;<i> It is the same process like to discover a S-CSCF.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>not really. the S-CSCFs are per subscriber while the I-CSCF is per
domain. Little-big difference that eliminates the need to query the
sensitive HSS from the operation.
&gt;<i> for example in the database is an entry open-ims.sk --&gt; ibcf1.open-ims.test
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Sorry, but you are just describing DNS. As I said, it's up to you if you
want to re-implement DNS, but you'll have to think again about all its
features.
&gt;<i> so the I-CSCF will send the Register to the ibcf1.open-ims.test which is
</I>&gt;<i> connected over a gateway to ibcfxy.open-ims.sk.
</I>&gt;<i> The Gateway will secure the connections between the IBCFs (VPN, IPSec etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> the IBCF will filtering informations that the other network doesn't need.
</I>&gt;<i> for example the Via headers to hide the inner network topologies.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>we have this already, but as this was developed a looong time ago, it's
part of the I-CSCF. The THIG functionality needs just to be extracted
from there and called &quot;IBCF&quot;. It will work for either if you put it
after the P-CSCF or before the I-CSCF, at any entry/exit-point from your
network. As I remember, even the Service-Route/Path things have been
integrated...

&gt;<i> Or adding additional Informations (AAA etc. )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there is no entry in the database the I-CSCF should send a DNS query to all
</I>&gt;<i> known IBCFs. if the resolve has success the I-CSCF will write an entry for the 
</I>&gt;<i>  network and IBCF in the database.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I think that this is exactly what I said before regarding your attempt
to close the network with a proprietary discovery procedure. What is the
problem with DNS? It can be secured, if you are concerned about that...
&gt;<i> (I hope that this outlines will displayed right)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> UE---&gt;P-CSCF--&gt;I-CSCF---&gt;IBCF--&gt;Gateway&lt;-----&gt;Gateway---&gt;IBCF---&gt;I-CSCF--&gt;S-CSCF
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Got it... Now again, what does the first I-CSCF do that the P-CSCF won't
be able to do by just adding a Route: IBCF to all initial requests going
out of your home network?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ibcf1.open-ims.test ---&gt;open-ims.sk
</I>&gt;<i> ibcf2.open-ims.test ---&gt;open-ims.fr
</I>&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps there could be another peering scenario with a peering network where all
</I>&gt;<i> IMS networks are connected and a central DNS register. But at the moment we
</I>&gt;<i> trying only to connect only one network over each IBCF.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I hope that this outlines will displayed right)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                (open-ims.fr)
</I>&gt;<i> UE---&gt;P-CSCF--&gt;I-CSCF---&gt;IBCF--&gt;Gateway&lt;-------
</I>&gt;<i>                                               |
</I>&gt;<i>                                               |
</I>&gt;<i>                                               V
</I>&gt;<i> UE---&gt;P-CSCF--&gt;I-CSCF---&gt;IBCF--&gt;Gateway&lt;---&gt;(DNS)&lt;---&gt;Gateway---&gt;IBCF---&gt;I-CSCF--&gt;S-CSCF
</I>&gt;<i>                (open-ims.test)                                  (open-ims.sk)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that you now understand why I want disable the the DNS resolving in the
</I>&gt;<i> P-CSCF (and only in the P-CSCF).
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I still think that there is no blocking reason for disabling DNS in the
P-CSCF. If you want to pipe your signaling through an IBCF, which is a
SIP proxy, then use a SIP way of doing it - insert a Route with the IBCF.
&gt;<i> At the moment my changes at the I-CSCF dont working because packets from
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openimscore-cscf">tim at open-ims.sk</A> dont pass the P-CSCF:  because the network cant resolve by DNS.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>if you have a route, then it will go to the first route not to the
request-uri.... that I think you can DNS resolve.

Cheers,
-Dragos
&gt;<i> I manipulated the DNS Server so that the Domain open-ims.sk will resolved to
</I>&gt;<i> pass the P-CSCF, but this was only a test to see what is happen on the changed
</I>&gt;<i> I-CSCF.
</I>&gt;<i> For future it would be easier for me to deactivate the DNS resolving on P-CSCF.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
