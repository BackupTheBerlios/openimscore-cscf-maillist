<PRE>&gt;<i> If I understand this, the AS must send the original message exactly as it
</I>&gt;<i> was received,
</I>&gt;<i> with the difference that the Route Header must only contain the second
</I>&gt;<i> address that was in the request' s
</I>&gt;<i> Route Header (SCSCF Address). 
</I>
Yes. This also results from basic SIP routing behaviour. If a server
receives a request it has to look into the Route header and according to RFC
3261 &#167;16.4: ... If the first value in the Route header field indicates this
proxy, the proxy MUST remove that value from the request.

&gt;<i> In this case, the request will travel
</I>&gt;<i> towards SCSCF and the next hop will
</I>&gt;<i> be handled by it as it would if a simple client (and not an AS) had sent
</I>&gt;<i> this request? I assume no other header
</I>&gt;<i> should be touched for this task?
</I>
This depends on the behaviour of the AS. It might act as a proxy or as a
B2BUA or as an originating UA. This requires to act on various headers
accordingly.
 
&gt;<i> Is this the way that all the next requests/responses for this call will
</I>&gt;<i> not be forwarded to AS (and leave
</I>&gt;<i> all routing from this point on to OpenIMS) ?
</I>
If the AS acts as a proxy and it does not set Record-Route it will not see
any further request/response of the dialog. If the AS acts as a B2BUA it
will.

Franz
