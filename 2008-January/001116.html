 Project:      Call Session Control Functions
 Version:      &lt;none&gt;
 Component:    Code
 Category:     feature requests
 Priority:     minor
 Assigned to:  
 Reported by:  krankes-kind
 Updated by:   krankes-kind
 Status:       active

In TS 24.229 (clause 7.2A.2.3) there are several new values defined for
&quot;integrity-protected&quot; parameter:


auth-param = &quot;integrity-protected&quot; EQUAL (&quot;yes&quot; / &quot;no&quot; / &quot;tls-pending&quot;
/ &quot;tls-yes&quot; / &quot;ip-assoc-pending&quot; / &quot;ip-assoc-yes&quot;)


The values in the &quot;integrity-protected&quot; field are defined as follows:
*&quot;yes&quot;: *indicates that a REGISTER request received in the P-CSCF is
protected using an IPsec security association and IMS AKA is used as
authentication scheme.
*&quot;no&quot;: *indicates that a REGISTER request received in the P-CSCF is not
protected using an IPsec security association and IMS AKA is used as
authentication scheme, i.e. this is an initial REGISTER request with the
Authorization header not containing a challenge response.
*&quot;tls-yes&quot;: *indicates that a REGISTER request is received in the
P-CSCF protected over a TLS connection and the Session ID, IP address
and port for the TLS connection are already bound to a private user
identity. The S-CSCF will decide whether or not to challenge such a
REGISTER request based on its policy. This is used in case of SIP digest
with TLS.
*&quot;tls-pending&quot;: *indicates that a REGISTER request is received in the
P-CSCF protected over a TLS connection and the Session ID, IP address
and port for the TLS connection are not yet bound to a private user
identity. The S-CSCF shall challenge such a REGISTER request if it does
not contain an Authorization header with a challenge response or if the
verification of the challenge response fails. This is used in case of
SIP digest with TLS.
*&quot;ip-assoc-yes&quot;: *indicates that a REGISTER request received in the
P-CSCF does map to an existing IP association in case SIP digest is used
without TLS.
*&quot;ip-assoc-pending&quot;: *indicates that a REGISTER request received in the
P-CSCF does not map to an existing IP association, and does contain a
challenge response in case SIP digest is used without TLS.


*NOTE 1: *In case of SIP digest is used with TLS, but the REGISTER
request was not received over TLS, the P-CSCF does not include an
&quot;integrity-protected&quot; field in the auth-param to indicate that an
initial REGISTER request was received not over an existing TLS session.
The S-CSCF will always challenge such a REGISTER request.
*NOTE 2: *In case of SIP digest is used without TLS, but the REGISTER
request was not received over TLS, the P-CSCF does not include an
&quot;integrity-protected&quot; field in the auth-param to indicate that the
REGISTER request does not map to an existing IP association, and does
not contain a challenge response. The S-CSCF will always challenge such
a REGISTER request.
*NOTE 3: *The value &quot;yes&quot; is also used when an initial REGISTER request
contains an Authorization header with a challenge response as in this
case the IPsec association is already in use, and its use by the UE
implicitly authenticates the UE. This is a difference to TLS case where
the use of TLS alone does not yet implicitly authenticates the UE. Hence
in the TLS case, for an initial REGISTER request containing an
Authorization header with a challenge response the value &quot;tls-pending&quot;
and not &quot;tls-yes&quot; is used.
