<PRE>Hi Dragos

Thx for your detailed answer.


I think we &quot;talk&quot; at cross :-),  in the most facts you write before i fully
agree.

First I want to introduce myself and the work we doing here.
I am a student (computer science - telecommunication   7. semester) at the
University of Applied Sciences for Telecommunication in Leipzig.
At the moment I working on this IMS/IBCF project beside my normal subjects.

And yes the University is under leadership of the &quot;Deutsche Telekom AG&quot;, but our
goal here in the NGN laboratory is not to find a ready to sell solution which
can used by the Telekom. More imported is to work with the IMS concept and its 
components, to find useful example Applications and bring it in the network.
To create Scenarios and proof them or simple extend functions of the SER.
This subject area is very new at our university and was established in spring
2007.
So I hope that you understand that we are not make research for the &quot;Deutsche
Telekom AG&quot;, but we have a look, on how some ideas perhaps can implemented in
the market in a few years.


To my concept that I want to implement in the OpenIMS.

We are trying to implement experimentally something like a peering interface to
the IMS network.

Its not to control the numbering plan, but in future the telcos need something
like a networkborder and well defined exchange interfaces which there need to 
peer with other telcos.

So this is were I working at.
we want build a connection to the OpenIMS network of our partner university in
Bratislava over such an interface.

So here i will explain my &quot;roaming&quot; concept more detailed.

We have two OpenIMS network  open-ims.test(Leipzig) for our network and a second
in Bratislava call it open-ims.sk.

If now a user from Bratislava[open-ims.sk] is attached to our network
[open-ims.test] everything will be the same as in Bratislava the only thing
which will change is the name of the entry point Proxy-CSCF.

So the client will send a Register to our P-CSCF and our P-CSCF should send this
register to our I-CSCF but now there should be the change.

The I-CSCF notice that this Register can not processed by our S-CSCF because we
dont know the network and so our S-CSCF don't has the User-Profile.

So the the I-CSCF should look in a database if there is an entry for the network
 [open-ims.sk] and a IBCF.
It is the same process like to discover a S-CSCF.

for example in the database is an entry open-ims.sk --&gt; ibcf1.open-ims.test
so the I-CSCF will send the Register to the ibcf1.open-ims.test which is
connected over a gateway to ibcfxy.open-ims.sk.
The Gateway will secure the connections between the IBCFs (VPN, IPSec etc.)
the IBCF will filtering informations that the other network doesn't need.
for example the Via headers to hide the inner network topologies.
Or adding additional Informations (AAA etc. )

If there is no entry in the database the I-CSCF should send a DNS query to all
known IBCFs. if the resolve has success the I-CSCF will write an entry for the 
 network and IBCF in the database.


(I hope that this outlines will displayed right)

UE---&gt;P-CSCF--&gt;I-CSCF---&gt;IBCF--&gt;Gateway&lt;-----&gt;Gateway---&gt;IBCF---&gt;I-CSCF--&gt;S-CSCF


ibcf1.open-ims.test ---&gt;open-ims.sk
ibcf2.open-ims.test ---&gt;open-ims.fr
.
.
.

Perhaps there could be another peering scenario with a peering network where all
IMS networks are connected and a central DNS register. But at the moment we
trying only to connect only one network over each IBCF.


(I hope that this outlines will displayed right)


               (open-ims.fr)
UE---&gt;P-CSCF--&gt;I-CSCF---&gt;IBCF--&gt;Gateway&lt;-------
                                              |
                                              |
                                              V
UE---&gt;P-CSCF--&gt;I-CSCF---&gt;IBCF--&gt;Gateway&lt;---&gt;(DNS)&lt;---&gt;Gateway---&gt;IBCF---&gt;I-CSCF--&gt;S-CSCF
               (open-ims.test)                                  (open-ims.sk)




I hope that you now understand why I want disable the the DNS resolving in the
P-CSCF (and only in the P-CSCF).

At the moment my changes at the I-CSCF dont working because packets from
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openimscore-cscf">tim at open-ims.sk</A> dont pass the P-CSCF:  because the network cant resolve by DNS.

I manipulated the DNS Server so that the Domain open-ims.sk will resolved to
pass the P-CSCF, but this was only a test to see what is happen on the changed
I-CSCF.
For future it would be easier for me to deactivate the DNS resolving on P-CSCF.



with best regards
Nick Burmester

sorry for my bad english :-)
