<PRE>Hello again,

thank you very much for these explanations! I think I was confused because I
thought
that if AS works as a proxy, than all responses following a request that
reaches AS
must pass through the same path backwards, no matter what the Route or
Record-Route
Header contains. I will study again on 3261 taking your helpful notes into
account, and
provide you with feedback, i hope a successful one next time!

Thank you,

Gary

&gt;<i> &gt; If I understand this, the AS must send the original message exactly as

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. This also results from basic SIP routing behaviour. If a server

</I>&gt;<i> RFC
</I>&gt;<i> 3261 &#167;16.4: ... If the first value in the Route header field indicates
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> proxy, the proxy MUST remove that value from the request.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In this case, the request will travel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; towards SCSCF and the next hop will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be handled by it as it would if a simple client (and not an AS) had sent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this request? I assume no other header
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be touched for this task?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This depends on the behaviour of the AS. It might act as a proxy or as a
</I>&gt;<i> B2BUA or as an originating UA. This requires to act on various headers
</I>&gt;<i> accordingly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is this the way that all the next requests/responses for this call will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not be forwarded to AS (and leave
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all routing from this point on to OpenIMS) ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the AS acts as a proxy and it does not set Record-Route it will not see
</I>&gt;<i> any further request/response of the dialog. If the AS acts as a B2BUA it
</I>&gt;<i> will.

Hi Gary,
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> well, the AS can in any case modify the request if it wants to. Some
</I>&gt;<i> things should remain the same, like the Call-ID, or else this will be
</I>&gt;<i> consider another dialog (which is not that bad if the first one is also
</I>&gt;<i> handled - the B2BUA AS case);. In any case, for the ISC to work the AS
</I>&gt;<i> should just behave according to RFC 3261 and do the loose-routing on the
</I>&gt;<i> Route headers. The first one is itself and as such would be removed and
</I>&gt;<i> the 2nd is the S-CSCF which will allow the message to return the the
</I>&gt;<i> proper S-CSCF. Nothing but proper SIP routing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then if it wants to see the rest of the dialog, it should add a
</I>&gt;<i> Record-Route to itself, just as any other SIP proxy would. If not, it
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't. Then all in-dialog routing would happen as standard SIP RFC
</I>&gt;<i> mentions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Simple SIP routing, nothing fancy ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> -Dragos
