<PRE>Hi Mario,

recently I noticed that for about 100.000 subscribers or more, the
persistency functionality does not work. This is because all the data is
serialized into a big structure and just after that it is all dumped.
Same thing happens on loading, when the entire thing is loaded into
memory and then decoded. At 100K, while dumping, it will normally run
out of memory. Probably loading it will fail too. I was targeting 1
million, so I had to change it.

Besides reorganizing the code into smaller chunks (extracted the db
related stuff from s/p_persistency to bin_db_p/scscf), my changes were
so far only for the file procedures. There I added some sequential
dumping (separated functions for open file, append, close file) of only
one hash-slot at a time (smaller chunks would just take too long to
lock/unlock while dumping to file). Also I added some sequential reading
- one big-enough buffer (several KiB) is read and then in a loop an
element is read / more data is loaded.

I committed my changes already and they seem to work - I got up to
300.000 subscribers and will do more in the next days.

Would be great if you could find the time to do similar changes on the
db functionality. Probably the cache is good, but the bulk would need
some changes.

Also to note is that the &quot;#define DEFAULT_SER_KILL_TIMEOUT 60 /* seconds
*/&quot; in config.h would have to be big enough to allow a dump of the whole
thing of SIGINT. In theory, this should be enough for 1 million subscribers.


Cheers,
-Dragos
