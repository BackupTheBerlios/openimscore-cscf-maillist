<PRE>Hello Dragos,

The IP fragmentation can be avoided (with wireshark) using the setting :

      preferences--&gt;protocols--&gt;ip--&gt;reassemble fragmented ip datagrams 
to *OFF*

You will see the very last Invite as a non fragmented SIP message.

I again did the trace, see the attachment for the capture and the scscf 
log both in one .zip file called trace2.zip

To refresh the scenario (after all the summer holidays) :

A number 2694 calls 2696, where 2696 is not registered. We have a Tas 
function in order to forward the call to 2695 in the condition that 2696 
is not registered.

Using the Wireshark trace, this is what happens, where 10.0.0.10 is the 
p/i/s-scscf, and 10.0.0.9 is the AS which is also known as the xtas.

frame 87  : initial Invite : 2694 calls 2696,
frame 95  : the Invite is send to the AS for origination for 
session-case=orig
frame 98  : the AS did some modification to the Invite and Via adds xtasorig

frame 265 : the invite again goes to the AS with session-case=termunreg
frame 270 : the AS did some modification to the Invite and Via adds 
xtastermunreg

frame 272 : the target number 2696 is not registered, and a 404 is send 
back to the AS
frame 273 : the 404 is being Ack'ed and the AS is now triggered due to 
this 404 to initiate
            a new Invite based of the Invite we used to reach 2696 in 
the last scenario (as in frame 270)
            but with another request uri.
       
frame 274 : the AS sends an Invite towards 2695 where we only changed 
the Request Uri in
            the first header.

A this point we reached line 3915 of the scscf.log file with debug 
option enabled.  At this line we have the  message 'Trans already in 
processing' and the call scenario stops here.

At this point everything stops here since the scscf does not treat the 
new Invite as being different because the new request uri was not 
checked to determine differences with any other Invite in the callstate. 
So we do not see any more messages.

So at this point I let the scenario running for a while and about 37 
seconds later I invoked a Hangup for the origination 2694. The logfile 
and the capture both show this event.

Let me know you need extra data.

Kind regards,

     - Dick Gooris
