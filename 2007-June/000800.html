New Revision: 351 <A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/openimscore?view=rev&amp;rev=351">http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/openimscore?view=rev&amp;rev=351</A> 

Log:
Removed the dead-locks for implicit sets when an implicit set identity would've been in the same registrar hash slot as the one being updated.

!WARNING! There are still dead-locks associated with implicit sets! For example, if there are 2 de-registrations for 2 identities comming in parallel, it is possible that they will lock each-other out!
