<PRE>Hi Franz,

IMS-Communicator does not support setting up IPSec SAs yet.

&gt;<i> Hello Franz,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The issue with SER is that it's damn hard to control from where the
</I>&gt;<i> messages would go out. Due to it's architecture, you might process your
</I>&gt;<i> message with a different process than the one listening on the right
</I>&gt;<i> ip:port for sending out and switching between processes is nothing
</I>&gt;<i> trivial. There is some good news as there seem to be some recent
</I>&gt;<i> development in SER in this direction, but this will take some time...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, getting back to the issue of having just one ip:port for the whole
</I>&gt;<i> thing. The idea is that you always have your rules. That means that any
</I>&gt;<i> traffic coming from negotiated associations towards the P-CSCF will be
</I>&gt;<i> dropped in the kernel if not using the security mechanism agreed on.
</I>&gt;<i> Because the destination is the same, the P-CSCF identifies the client by
</I>&gt;<i> the source ip:port in this case. If the source ip:port are protected
</I>&gt;<i> then non-secure traffic is dropped automatically in the kernel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For outbound traffic, when sending towards the client, the kernel
</I>&gt;<i> automatically encrypts all the data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So in the end, my conclusion back when we added this feature was that it
</I>&gt;<i> is sufficient if at least one of the P-CSCF or the UE would use
</I>&gt;<i> different ports. Now this might break that rule form 33.203 that you
</I>&gt;<i> have cited, but in the end the effect is exactly the same and I think
</I>&gt;<i> that the rules is too restrictive related to how the actual
</I>&gt;<i> implementations would work. The text somehow implies that you control
</I>&gt;<i> the IPSec implementation from a higher layer than you do with the Linux
</I>&gt;<i> kernel, but really once you set the rules, you do not get to see any
</I>&gt;<i> more if your message came protected or not because all unprotected ones
</I>&gt;<i> will be discarded silently before reaching your application. Or maybe,
</I>&gt;<i> for high capacity implementation, when a hardware IPSec solution is used
</I>&gt;<i> in front of the P-CSCF, you could for example receive everything
</I>&gt;<i> decrypted, just tagged if it was received with protection or not and
</I>&gt;<i> then make the decision in the application layer if to discard
</I>&gt;<i> unprotected messages on protected ports.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course that it would've been better to have individual ports for each
</I>&gt;<i> client, but this might really not be practical because it will introduce
</I>&gt;<i> a limitation on the number of clients. Then having universal
</I>&gt;<i> unprotected, port_c and port_s on the P-CSCF, but the same for all
</I>&gt;<i> clients, would be also be better, but it's quite hard to do that with SER.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I have implemented it I have built my own UE simulation because
</I>&gt;<i> none were available. Then there was recently some bug discovered so I
</I>&gt;<i> asked Florin Popescu (not Adrian :), Popescu is a common Romanian name)
</I>&gt;<i> to try it with SIPp. This required some changes to SIPp and the patch
</I>&gt;<i> still lays somewhere in my Inbox waiting to be applied. I will try and
</I>&gt;<i> get back to you as soon as I will make it work myself with the full
</I>&gt;<i> scenario to replicate it.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Dragos,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I still struggle with the setup of IPsec SAs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; You have changed the port-c and port-s and this won't work. Please us
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the same port for both and also the listen parameter. It should work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I understand from TS 33.203 that the protected ports have to be different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the unprotected port. Chapter 7.2 says:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;No unprotected messages shall be sent from or received on the ports port_ps
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and port_pc. From a security point of view, unprotected messages may be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; received on any port which is different from the ports port_ps and port_pc.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The same rule is also applied to the client:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;No unprotected messages shall be sent from or received on the ports port_us
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and port_uc. From a security point of view, unprotected messages may be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; received on any port which is different from the ports port_us and port_uc.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also IMS-communicator does not strictly follow this rule when I read the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; following comment in ims-communicator.xml:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;if SECURITY_PORT_C empty, port-c parameter is filled with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PREFERRED_LOCAL_PORT&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only partially successful setup of IPsec SAs I got when I used for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protected server port the same port as for the unprotected one. Partially
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; successful, because only in this case the 4 IPsec-setup scripts in P-CSCF
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are executed, but the IPsec SA are not used. In all other cases only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;ipsec_P_Inc_Req.sh&quot; is called and the &quot;ERROR: on_reply processing failed&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; follows.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I wonder which parameters have been used to successful setup IPsec SAs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; between OpenIMSCore and IMS-communicator. I used revision 309 of OpenIMSCore
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and ims-communicator-windows-release-070605 and maybe that's important: no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; NAT to avoid further complexity.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers
