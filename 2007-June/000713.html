<PRE>Hi Dragos,

I still struggle with the setup of IPsec SAs.
 
&gt;<i> You have changed the port-c and port-s and this won't work. Please us
</I>&gt;<i> the same port for both and also the listen parameter. It should work.
</I>
I understand from TS 33.203 that the protected ports have to be different
from the unprotected port. Chapter 7.2 says: 
&quot;No unprotected messages shall be sent from or received on the ports port_ps
and port_pc. From a security point of view, unprotected messages may be
received on any port which is different from the ports port_ps and port_pc.&quot;

The same rule is also applied to the client: 
&quot;No unprotected messages shall be sent from or received on the ports port_us
and port_uc. From a security point of view, unprotected messages may be
received on any port which is different from the ports port_us and port_uc.&quot;

Also IMS-communicator does not strictly follow this rule when I read the
following comment in ims-communicator.xml:
&quot;if SECURITY_PORT_C empty, port-c parameter is filled with
PREFERRED_LOCAL_PORT&quot;

The only partially successful setup of IPsec SAs I got when I used for the
protected server port the same port as for the unprotected one. Partially
successful, because only in this case the 4 IPsec-setup scripts in P-CSCF
are executed, but the IPsec SA are not used. In all other cases only
&quot;ipsec_P_Inc_Req.sh&quot; is called and the &quot;ERROR: on_reply processing failed&quot;
follows.

I wonder which parameters have been used to successful setup IPsec SAs
between OpenIMSCore and IMS-communicator. I used revision 309 of OpenIMSCore
and ims-communicator-windows-release-070605 and maybe that's important: no
NAT to avoid further complexity.

Cheers
Franz
