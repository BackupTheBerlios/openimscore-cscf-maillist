<PRE>Hello Franz,

The issue with SER is that it's damn hard to control from where the
messages would go out. Due to it's architecture, you might process your
message with a different process than the one listening on the right
ip:port for sending out and switching between processes is nothing
trivial. There is some good news as there seem to be some recent
development in SER in this direction, but this will take some time...

Well, getting back to the issue of having just one ip:port for the whole
thing. The idea is that you always have your rules. That means that any
traffic coming from negotiated associations towards the P-CSCF will be
dropped in the kernel if not using the security mechanism agreed on.
Because the destination is the same, the P-CSCF identifies the client by
the source ip:port in this case. If the source ip:port are protected
then non-secure traffic is dropped automatically in the kernel.

For outbound traffic, when sending towards the client, the kernel
automatically encrypts all the data.

So in the end, my conclusion back when we added this feature was that it
is sufficient if at least one of the P-CSCF or the UE would use
different ports. Now this might break that rule form 33.203 that you
have cited, but in the end the effect is exactly the same and I think
that the rules is too restrictive related to how the actual
implementations would work. The text somehow implies that you control
the IPSec implementation from a higher layer than you do with the Linux
kernel, but really once you set the rules, you do not get to see any
more if your message came protected or not because all unprotected ones
will be discarded silently before reaching your application. Or maybe,
for high capacity implementation, when a hardware IPSec solution is used
in front of the P-CSCF, you could for example receive everything
decrypted, just tagged if it was received with protection or not and
then make the decision in the application layer if to discard
unprotected messages on protected ports.

Of course that it would've been better to have individual ports for each
client, but this might really not be practical because it will introduce
a limitation on the number of clients. Then having universal
unprotected, port_c and port_s on the P-CSCF, but the same for all
clients, would be also be better, but it's quite hard to do that with SER.

When I have implemented it I have built my own UE simulation because
none were available. Then there was recently some bug discovered so I
asked Florin Popescu (not Adrian :), Popescu is a common Romanian name)
to try it with SIPp. This required some changes to SIPp and the patch
still lays somewhere in my Inbox waiting to be applied. I will try and
get back to you as soon as I will make it work myself with the full
scenario to replicate it.

</I>&gt;<i> I understand from TS 33.203 that the protected ports have to be different

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;No unprotected messages shall be sent from or received on the ports port_ps
</I>&gt;<i> and port_pc. From a security point of view, unprotected messages may be
</I>&gt;<i> received on any port which is different from the ports port_ps and port_pc.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The same rule is also applied to the client: 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;No unprotected messages shall be sent from or received on the ports port_us
</I>&gt;<i> and port_uc. From a security point of view, unprotected messages may be
</I>&gt;<i> received on any port which is different from the ports port_us and port_uc.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also IMS-communicator does not strictly follow this rule when I read the
</I>&gt;<i> following comment in ims-communicator.xml:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;if SECURITY_PORT_C empty, port-c parameter is filled with
</I>&gt;<i> PREFERRED_LOCAL_PORT&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only partially successful setup of IPsec SAs I got when I used for the
</I>&gt;<i> protected server port the same port as for the unprotected one. Partially
</I>&gt;<i> successful, because only in this case the 4 IPsec-setup scripts in P-CSCF
</I>&gt;<i> are executed, but the IPsec SA are not used. In all other cases only
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ipsec_P_Inc_Req.sh&quot; is called and the &quot;ERROR: on_reply processing failed&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> follows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder which parameters have been used to successful setup IPsec SAs
</I>&gt;<i> between OpenIMSCore and IMS-communicator. I used revision 309 of OpenIMSCore
</I>&gt;<i> and ims-communicator-windows-release-070605 and maybe that's important: no
</I>&gt;<i> NAT to avoid further complexity.
