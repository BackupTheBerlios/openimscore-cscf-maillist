<PRE>Hello everybody,

on ISC (the interface between the S-CSCF and an AS), the S-CSCF shall
make sure that some SIP requests that are passed to the AS have *two*
P-Asserted-Identity headers: One with a SIP URI, one with a TEL URI.

The condition is: If the user is using a service profile that is
associated with a SIP URI as well as with a TEL URI, both
P-Asserted-Identity headers shall be present.


As far as I see, OpenIMSCore doesn't fully support this (yet).


Here is a short excerpt from the spec.

--- begin 24.229 V7.7.0 ---

5.4.3 General treatment for all dialogs and standalone transactions
excluding requests terminated by the S-CSCF

[...]

5.4.3.2 Requests initiated by the served user

When the S-CSCF receives from the served user or from a PSI an initial
request for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction

[...]

the S-CSCF shall:


[...]

9) if there is no original dialog identifier present in the topmost
Route header of the incoming request and if the SCSCF has knowledge that
the SIP URI contained in the received P-Asserted-Identity header is an
alias SIP URI for a tel URI, add a second P-Asserted-Identity header
containing this tel-URI, including the display name associated with the
tel URI, if available.

If the P-Asserted-Identity header contains only a tel URI, the S-CSCF
shall add a second P-Asserted-Identity header containing a SIP URI. The
added SIP URI shall contain in the user part a &quot;+&quot; followed by the
international public telecommunication number contained in tel URI, and
user's home domain name in the hostport part. The added SIP URI shall
contain the same value in the display name as contained in the tel URI.
The S-CSCF shall also add a user parameter equals &quot;phone&quot; to the SIP
URI;

NOTE 4: The S-CSCF recognizes that a given SIP URI is an alias SIP URI
of a tel URI, since they have the same service profile and belong to the
same set of implicitly registered public user identities. If tel URI is
shared URI so is the alias SIP URI.

[...]

--- end 24.229 V7.7.0 ---


More from the spec: A useful example which illustrates this behaviour is
given in 24.341 V7.1.0, Table B.5-3. Note that in table B.5-2, where the
same SIP request is passed from the P-CSCF to the S-CSCF, there is only
a SIP URI present. On the next leg (between S-CSCF and AS) there are
both SIP URI and TEL URI present.


Now, back to OpenIMSCore.

I have looked through the source code and found something interesting in
'scscf/registrar.c': OpenIMSCore's function &quot;S_add_p_asserted_identity&quot;
seems to be close but not complete.

(a) It handles a special case (&quot;sip:+1234567&quot; -&gt; &quot;tel:+1234567&quot;) which I
wasn't aware of (and I can't find it in the spec).

(b) It also looks like it can handle &quot;tel:+1234567&quot; -&gt;
&quot;sip:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openimscore-cscf">user_public at open_ims.test</A>&quot;, but I have not had a good test
environment yet to prove this.

(c) It does NOT seem to have any support for
&quot;sip:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openimscore-cscf">user_public at open_ims.test</A>&quot; -&gt; &quot;tel:+1234567&quot;. Unfortunately, this
is what interests me most at the moment and how I got aware of this
problem.
